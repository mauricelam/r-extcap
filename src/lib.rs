//! Write [extcap](https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/extcap.html)
//! programs in Rust.
//!
//! The extcap interface is a versatile plugin interface used by Wireshark to
//! allow external binaries to act as capture interfaces. The extcap interface
//! itself is generic and can be used by applications other than Wireshark, like
//! Wireshark's command line sibling `tshark`. For the sake of brevity, in the
//! documentation we will refer to the host application simply as Wireshark.
//!
//! ### Extcap overview
//!
//! 1. `--extcap-interfaces`: In this step, Wireshark asks the extcap for its
//!    list of supported interfaces, version metadata, and the list of toolbar
//!    controls.
//! 2. `--extcap-dlts`: Invoked once for each interface, Wireshark asks the
//!    extcap program for the data link type associated with the interface.
//! 3. `--extcap-config`: Invoked for each interface upon user request,
//!    Wireshark asks the extcap program for a list of configurations to
//!    populate a config dialog in the UI.
//! 4. `--capture`: The main part of the extcap program â€“ invoked once when the
//!    user selects an interface for capture, to tell the extcap to start
//!    capturing packets. Captured packets should be written to the `--fifo` in
//!    the PCAP format.
//!
//! ## Getting started
//!
//! To create an extcap using this library, these are the high level steps:
//!
//! 1. Create a struct with `#[derive(clap::Parser)]`, and add
//!    [`ExtcapArgs`](crate::ExtcapArgs) as one of the fields with the
//!    `#[command(flatten)]` attribute.
//!
//!    ```
//!    #[derive(Debug, clap::Parser)]
//!    struct AppArgs {
//!        #[command(flatten)]
//!        extcap: r_extcap::ExtcapArgs,
//!
//!        // Other args for extcap (see the `configs` module)
//!    }
//!    ```
//!
//! 2. In a `lazy_static`, define the necessary
//!    [interfaces](crate::interface::Interface), [toolbar
//!    controls](crate::controls::ToolbarControl), and
//!    [configs](crate::config::ConfigTrait). If you are unsure, you can simply
//!    start with the [`Interfaces`](crate::interface::Interface) you want to
//!    capture and add the others later as needed.
//!
//! 3. In the `main` function, parse the arguments and call
//!    [`ExtcapArgs::run`](crate::ExtcapArgs::run). Use the returned
//!    [`ExtcapStep`](crate::ExtcapStep) to perform the requested operation.
//!    There are 5 steps:
//!
//!     1. [`InterfacesStep`](crate::InterfacesStep): List the interfaces that
//!            can be captured by this program, as well as the metadata and
//!            toolbar controls associated.
//!     2. [`DltsStep`](crate::DltsStep): Prints the DLTs for a given interface.
//!     3. [`ConfigStep`](crate::ConfigStep): Optional, provide a list of UI
//!            configuration options that the user can change.
//!     4. [`ReloadConfigStep`](crate::ReloadConfigStep): Optional, if
//!            [`SelectorConfig::reload`](crate::config::SelectorConfig)
//!            is configured in one of the configs, invoked to reload the list
//!            of options the user can choose from.
//!     5. [`CaptureStep`](crate::CaptureStep): described below.
//!
//!  4. In the [`CaptureStep`](crate::CaptureStep), start capturing packets from
//!     the external interface, and write the packets to
//!     [`CaptureStep::fifo`](crate::CaptureStep) using the
//!     [`pcap_file`](https://docs.rs/pcap-file/latest/pcap_file/index.html)
//!     crate.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use lazy_static::lazy_static;
//! use clap::Parser;
//! use r_extcap::{cargo_metadata, ExtcapArgs, ExtcapStep, interface::*, controls::*, config::*};
//!

//! struct AppArgs {
//!     #[command(flatten)]
//!     extcap: ExtcapArgs,
//! }
//!
//! lazy_static! {
//!     // static ref CONFIG_FOO: SelectorConfig = ...;
//!     // static ref CONFIG_BAR: StringConfig = ...;
//!
//!     // static ref CONTROL_A: BooleanControl = ...;
//!
//!     // static ref INTERFACE_1: Interface = ...;
//! }
//!
//! fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
//!     match AppArgs::parse().extcap.run()? {
//!         ExtcapStep::Interfaces(interfaces_step) => {
//!             interfaces_step.list_interfaces(
//!                 &cargo_metadata!(),

//!                 ],
//!             );
//!         }
//!         ExtcapStep::Dlts(dlts_step) => {
//!             dlts_step.print_from_interfaces(&[
//!                 // &*INTERFACE_1,
//!             ])?;
//!         }
//!         ExtcapStep::Config(config_step) => config_step.list_configs(&[
//!             // &*CONFIG_FOO,
//!             // &*CONFIG_BAR,
//!         ]),
//!         ExtcapStep::ReloadConfig(reload_config_step) => {
//!             reload_config_step.reload_from_configs(&[
//!                 // &*CONFIG_FOO,
//!                 // &*CONFIG_BAR,
//!             ])?;
//!         }
//!         ExtcapStep::Capture(capture_step) => {
//!             // Run capture
//!         }
//!     }
//!     Ok(())
//! }
